# Tip to turn on Ubuntu 20.04 Wi-Fi Hotspot


> Given the fact that your computer Wi-Fi card supports Wi-Fi Hotspot (you can check with the command `iw list`).

On Ubuntu 20.04, If the option "**Turn On Wi-Fi Hotspot...**" is **gray out**  in your **Wi-Fi Settings**, this tab switching trick will solve the problem.

Simply click on another tab like Bluetooth or Network, then go back to "Wi-Fi" tab again, you now should see this option "**Turn On Wi-Fi Hotspot...**" available.

This trick could save you hours of headache!
